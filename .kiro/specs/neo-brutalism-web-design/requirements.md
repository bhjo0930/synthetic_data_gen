# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing a comprehensive Neo-Brutalism design system for web interfaces, focusing on bold visual aesthetics, experimental typography, and distinctive transition animations. The design system emphasizes raw, unfinished aesthetics with high contrast elements while maintaining accessibility and usability standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to experience bold and distinctive visual design elements, so that the interface feels modern, edgy, and memorable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display flat backgrounds using only white (#FFFFFF) or black (#000000) as base colors
2. WHEN UI elements are rendered THEN the system SHALL apply thick pure-black (#000000) outlines around all interactive components
3. WHEN color is used THEN the system SHALL implement bold primary color blocks without gradients
4. WHEN shadows are applied THEN the system SHALL use only solid-form shadows, never soft or blurred effects
5. WHEN typography is displayed THEN the system SHALL use large, experimental sans-serif fonts with strong visual impact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to experience unique page transitions, so that navigation feels intentional and matches the bold aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL use sudden jump cuts instead of smooth transitions
2. WHEN page transitions occur THEN the system SHALL implement stark flashes or quick "hard edge" wipes
3. WHEN components change state THEN the system SHALL avoid smooth fades or gentle blurring effects
4. WHEN transitions complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the abrupt, intentional aesthetic throughout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to see intentionally asymmetrical and layered layouts, so that the interface feels experimental and breaks conventional design patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN elements are positioned THEN the system SHALL use intentionally asymmetrical placements
2. WHEN multiple elements are present THEN the system SHALL implement layered or overlapping arrangements
3. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure strong contrast for readability
4. WHEN icons and buttons are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain a raw, unfinished visual style
5. WHEN layout is responsive THEN the system SHALL preserve asymmetrical characteristics across screen sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to interact with distinctive visual accents and effects, so that the interface feels engaging and matches the retro-digital aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retro elements are needed THEN the system SHALL incorporate pixel-art style details
2. WHEN users hover over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL trigger aggressive, noticeable hover effects
3. WHEN transitions occur THEN the system SHALL implement deliberately "clunky" animation timing
4. WHEN cursor interaction happens THEN the system SHALL provide distinctive cursor effects that match the aesthetic
5. WHEN visual accents are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the overall Neo-Brutalism style

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web user with accessibility needs, I want the interface to remain usable and clear, so that the bold aesthetic doesn't compromise my ability to navigate and interact with the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
2. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators for focus states
3. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion when requested
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain logical tab order and keyboard accessibility
5. WHEN content is presented THEN the system SHALL ensure readability despite the rough visual presentation
6. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate semantic markup and labels
